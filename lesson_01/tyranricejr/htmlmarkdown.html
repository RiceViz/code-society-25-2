<p>I am a software engineer and game developer with a passion for artificial intelligence, gamification, and anything related to space!</p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Delaware with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, earning a cumulative GPA of 3.5. Throughout college, I held several leadership roles, including Resident Assistant, co-founder and president of the campus Game Development Club, team leader in the Esports program, and participant in a freshman leadership program. I also competed in multiple hackathons and game jams, earning over $2,000 in awards for my contributions and innovation.</p>

<h1>My Tech Stack</h1>
<p>I prefer coding in C#, Python, and Typescript, but I can also use similar languages in regards like Java, Javascript and others. These main 3 coding languages cover a good basis of what things I like to create and develop. They will be listed below in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Game Development: C# and Unity</li>
<li>AI &amp; Machine Learning: Python, PyTorch and TensorFlow</li>
<li>Full Stack Development: Typescript &amp; Javascript, React, Angular and Vue</li>
</ol>
<p>I also made different variations of these tech stacks, such as a game using Python and a Python library that allowed GUIs. In general, I like app, game, and web development and the act of creating something, even if its in turns of artificial intelligence!</p>
